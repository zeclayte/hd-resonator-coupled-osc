# Implementation of the Resonator Network in Coupled Oscillators
The Resonator Network [1] is an efficient computational model to factorize factors in composite hypervectors in Hyper-Dimensional Computing. It turns out the dynamic of its continues version resembles the dynamic of a network of coupled oscillators. This notebook demonstrates how a network of coupled oscillators is a natural analog implementation of the Resonator Network.

# Setup
